"""Module for working the logical IP interfaces in EOS

This module provides an API for configuring logical IP interfaces using
EOS and eAPI.

Parameters:
    name (string): The interface name the configuration is in reference
        to.  The interface name is the full interface identifier

    address (string): The interface IP address in the form of
        address/len.

    mtu (integer): The interface MTU value.  The MTU value accepts
        integers in the range of 68 to 65535 bytes
