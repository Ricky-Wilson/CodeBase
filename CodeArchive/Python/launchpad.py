        Use this method to get a `Launchpad` object. If the end-user

        and they'll be asked to log in and authorize a desktop
        integration. The authorized Launchpad credential will be
        stored securely: in the GNOME keyring, the KDE Wallet, or in

        The next time your program (or any other program run by that

        will be prompted to unlock their keyring (or equivalent), and
        the credential will be retrieved from local storage and
        reused.

        You can customize this behavior in three ways:

        1. Pass in a filename to `credentials_file`. The end-user's
           credential will be written to that file, and on subsequent
           runs read from that file.

        2. Subclass `CredentialStore` and pass in an instance of the
           subclass as `credential_store`. This lets you change how
           the end-user's credential is stored and retrieved locally.

        3. Subclass `RequestTokenAuthorizationEngine` and pass in an
           instance of the subclass as `authorization_engine`. This
           lets you change change what happens when the end-user needs
           to authorize the Launchpad credential.
