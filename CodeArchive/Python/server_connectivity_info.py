    Such objects are returned by `ServerConnectivityTester.perform()` if connectivity testing was successful, and should
    never be instantiated directly.

    Attributes:
        hostname (str): The server's hostname.
        port (int): The server's TLS port number.
        ip_address (Optional[str]): The server's IP address. None if we are connecting through a proxy.
        tls_wrapped_protocol (TlsWrappedProtocolEnum): The protocol wrapped in TLS (HTTP, XMPP, etc.) that the server
            expects.
        tls_server_name_indication (str): The hostname to set within the Server Name Indication TLS extension.
        xmpp_to_hostname (Optional[str]): The hostname to set within the `to` attribute of the XMPP stream; only used
            if the `tls_wrapped_protocol` is an XMPP protocol.
        client_auth_credentials (Optional[ClientAuthenticationCredentials]): The client certificate and private key
            needed to perform mutual authentication with
            the server. If not supplied, SSLyze will attempt to connect to the server without performing mutual
            authentication.
        http_tunneling_settings (Optional[HttpConnectTunnelingSettings]): The HTTP proxy configuration to use in order
            to tunnel the scans through a proxy.
            If not supplied, SSLyze will run the scans by directly connecting to the server.
        highest_ssl_version_supported (OpenSslVersionEnum): The highest version of SSL/TLS supported by the server,
            as detected when doing connectivity testing.
        openssl_cipher_string_supported (str): An OpenSSL cipher string that contains at least one
            cipher suite supported by
            the server, as detected when doing connectivity testing.
        client_auth_requirement (ClientAuthenticationServerConfigurationEnum): Whether the support requires client
            authentication.
