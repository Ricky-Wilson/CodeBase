This is the Angular Phonecat application adjusted to fit our boilerplate project
structure.

The following changes from vanilla Phonecat are applied:

* E2E tests have been moved to the parent directory, where `run-e2e-tests` can
  discover and run them along with all the other examples.
* Most of the phone JSON and image data removed in the interest of keeping
  repo weight down. Keeping enough to retain testability of the app.

## Running the app

Start like any example

    npm run start

## Running E2E tests

Like for any example (at the project root):

    gulp run-e2e-tests --filter=phonecat-3
