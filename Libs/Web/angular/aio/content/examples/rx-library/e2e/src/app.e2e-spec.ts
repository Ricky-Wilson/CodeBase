 * This example project is special in that it is not a cli app. To run tests appropriate for this

 *
 * This is an empty placeholder file to ensure that `aio/tools/examples/run-example-e2e.js` runs
 * tests for this project.
 *
 * TODO: Fix our infrastructure/tooling, so that this hack is not necessary.
