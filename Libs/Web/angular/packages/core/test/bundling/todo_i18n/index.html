      Script tag which bootstraps the application. Use `?debug` in URL to select
      the debug version of the script.

      There are two scripts sources: `bundle.min.js` and `bundle.min_debug.js` You can
      switch between which bundle the browser loads to experiment with the application.

      - `bundle.min.js`: Is what the site would serve to their users. It has gone
        through rollup, build-optimizer, and uglify with tree shaking.
        - In `devserver` mode `bundle.min.js` is a bit misnamed since it is concatenated
          individual files which are not minified.
      - `bundle.min_debug.js`: Is what the developer would like to see when debugging
        the application. It has also gone through full pipeline of rollup, build-optimizer,
        and uglify, however special flags were passed to uglify to prevent inlining and
        property renaming.
