/**
 * Ensure that the parents of directives and components that have no constructor are also decorated
 * as a `Directive`.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * ```
 * export class BasePlain {
 *   constructor(private vcr: ViewContainerRef) {}
 * }
 *
 * @Directive({selector: '[blah]'})
 * export class DerivedDir extends BasePlain {}
 * ```
 *
 * When compiling `DerivedDir` which extends the undecorated `BasePlain` class, the compiler needs
 * to generate a directive def (`Éµdir`) for `DerivedDir`. In particular, it needs to generate a
 * factory function that creates instances of `DerivedDir`.
 *
 * As `DerivedDir` has no constructor, the factory function for `DerivedDir` must delegate to the
 * factory function for `BasePlain`. But for this to work, `BasePlain` must have a factory function,
 * itself.
 *
 * This migration adds a `Directive` decorator to such undecorated parent classes, to ensure that
 * the compiler will create the necessary factory function.
 *
 * The resulting code looks like:
 *
 * ```
 * @Directive()
 * export class BasePlain {
 *   constructor(private vcr: ViewContainerRef) {}
 * }
 *
 * @Directive({selector: '[blah]'})
 * export class DerivedDir extends BasePlain {}
 * ```
