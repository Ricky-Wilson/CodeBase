// Mapping of puppeteer releases to their default Chrome version
// derived from https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/blob/master/docs/api.md.
// The puppeteer package.json file contains the compatible Chrome revision such as
// "chromium_revision": "722234" but this does not map easily to the Chrome version
// so we use this mapping here instead.
